### React Native

The React Native bit has been moved to a child directory.


### Running it

You'll need an API Key from here [http://developer.trimet.org/appid/registration/](http://developer.trimet.org/appid/registration/)

Then you'll need to run stuff with `APPID={APIKEYHERE} npm run dev`. Same goes for the server. Just needs to be on `process.env`. Why you care about this if you're not in Portland? Hell if I know.
